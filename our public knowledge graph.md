# Where to find our public knowledge graph

A small army of us are sharing a public knowledge graph. [data-public](http://github.com/synchrony/data-public) contains our shareability 0.75 notes, and [data-universal](http://github.com/synchrony/data-universal) the shareability 1.0 notes.

We seek more wise contributors.

If you just want to see it, an easier way to access it is by using the online graph -- the first option in the [install guide](https://github.com/synchrony/smsn/wiki/Installation).
